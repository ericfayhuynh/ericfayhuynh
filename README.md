## 🙋‍♂️About
If you haven't figured it out by now, my name's Eric. I currently reside in the greater Los Angeles area. I am currently making a career change from biology and pivoting into the data field. I am currently enrolled at the University of Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. I am excited to learn the many different tools the data field has to offer such as SQL, Python, R, and many more. I view data analytics as a perfect stepping stone into a career encompassing data science and biostatistics. It is crucial for me to have a career environment where I can upskill, encourage optimization, and foster a learning culture.
