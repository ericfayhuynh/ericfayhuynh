## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAbout
Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I am excited to showcase the skills and knowledge I have acquired so far in the data field, with a lot more to come. As a passionate learner, I have delved into various tools like SQL, Python, and R, which have enabled me to work on intriguing data projects. This portfolio serves as a testament to my journey in data analytics and the application of these tools to real-world scenarios.

A little about me: My name is Eric, and I currently reside in the greater Los Angeles area. I am making a career change from biology to pursue my passion for data science and biostatistics. Currently enrolled in the University of Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp, I am eager to explore the many opportunities and challenges that the data field has to offer. I view data analytics as a perfect stepping stone into a fulfilling career, where I can foster a learning culture, encourage optimization, and continuously upskill.

Feel free to explore my GitHub portfolio! I am excited to showcase the skills I have acquired and the projects I have diligently worked on.
