### Hi!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I am currently making a career change from biology and pivoting into the data field. I am currently enrolled at the University of Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. I am excited to learn the many different tools the data field has to offer such as SQL, Python, R, and many more. I view data analytics as a perfect stepping stone into a career encompassing data science and biostatistics.
